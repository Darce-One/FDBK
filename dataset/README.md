This folder is left empty by default, but is included as a place to insert the dataset you
want to train your model on. To train your model, make sure to include the `samples/`
directory with your sounds, and the `params.json` that the supercollider script has created for you.

Once these files are in here, you can run the training script from the `train/` directory.
